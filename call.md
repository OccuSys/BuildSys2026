# Call for Papers

Occupant-Centric Energy Systems (OccuSys) invites submissions that advance modeling, control, and integration of human behavior in building and energy systems.

This workshop addresses the growing need for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of human behavior modeling, building systems, and energy management.

## Topics include (but are not limited to)

### Modeling approaches
- Data-driven vs. physics-based vs. hybrid models  
- Personal comfort models and preference learning  
- Occupancy detection and prediction methods  

### Control and optimization
- Occupant-centric controls  
- Adaptive and personalized comfort control  
- Model predictive control with behavior forecasting  
- Privacy-preserving controls  

### Beyond static comfort boundaries
- Adaptive thermal comfort models in practice  
- Context-dependent comfort  
- Thermal comfort equity and individual differences  

### Data and benchmarking
- Longitudinal studies and real-world deployment  
- Wearable sensors and physiological monitoring  
- Privacy, ethics, and user acceptance  

### Integration with energy systems
- Demand response enabled by occupant behavior prediction  
- Thermal energy storage and occupant flexibility  
- Building-to-grid services considering occupant comfort  

### Theory and methods
- Interpretability and explainability in ML-based models  
- Validation and verification methodologies  
- Interdisciplinary approaches  

> Submission instructions and formatting details will be added soon (following ACM BuildSys workshop policies).
