## Submission

We invite submissions of **original research and work in progress** related to occupant-centric energy systems. Submissions must be unpublished and not under review for any other venue.

Papers must be **at most 6 pages (single-spaced, US Letter 8.5” × 11”)**, including figures, tables, references, and appendices.

Submissions must use the official [ACM proceedings template (sigconf format)](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
(LaTeX preferred or Word). and comply with ACM formatting requirements (9-pt font). Authors must anonymize their manuscripts by:
- Enabling the `anonymous` option in the template
- Using the `anonsuppress` section where appropriate  

Papers that do not comply with size, formatting, or anonymization requirements will not be reviewed.

All papers must be submitted via **HotCRP**:  
[https://occusys.hotcrp.com/](https://occusys.hotcrp.com/)

Registration is handled through the official  
[ACM BuildSys 2026 website](https://buildsys.acm.org/2026/).
